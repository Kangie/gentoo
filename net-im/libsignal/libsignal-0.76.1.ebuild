# Build-time dependencies that are executed during the emerge process, and

#BDEPEND="virtual/pkgconfig"

	# You could use something similar to the following lines to
	# configure your package before compilation.  The "|| die" portion
	# at the end will stop the build process if the command fails.
	# You should use this at the end of critical commands in the build
	# process.  (Hint: Most commands are critical, that is, the build
	# process should abort if they aren't successful.)

	#	--infodir=/usr/share/info \

	# Note the use of --infodir and --mandir, above. This is to make
	# this package FHS 2.2-compliant.  For more information, see

	# use emake -j1 to limit make to a single process.  The -j1 is a
	# visual clue to others that the makefiles have bugs that have been
	# worked around.
